In order to learn how to build RiseMP from source, check out [the documentation](./BUILD.md).

### Building from source

#### Prerequisites

- [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) with the following individual components:
  - Windows SDK
  - Windows app development workload
- Git for Windows

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Rise-Software/Rise-Media-Player.git
```

#### Prepare credentials

Create a file called `LastFM.cs` in `Rise.Common.Constants`, and paste the following contents:

```cs
namespace Rise.Common.Constants
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Contains last.fm related constants.
    /// </summary>
    public class LastFM
    {
        public const string Key = "YourAPIKey";
        public const string Secret = "YourSecret";

        public const string VaultResource = "RiseMP - LastFM account";
    }
}
```

This will be enough to build the app, but if you want last.fm support, you should [get a last.fm API key](https://www.last.fm/api#getting-started). After doing this, replace the value of the `Key` and `Secret` constants with your own API key and secret key respectively. After doing this, last.fm functionality should be enabled.

#### Build the project

To build Rise Media Player for development, open the `RiseMP.sln` item in Visual Studio. Right-click on the `Rise.App` packaging project in solution explorer and select ‚ÄòSet as Startup item‚Äô. Then press <kbd>F5</kbd> or your selected build & deploy keybind to build the app and launch it.
